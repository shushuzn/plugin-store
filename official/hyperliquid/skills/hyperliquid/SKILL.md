# Hyperliquid Perpetual & Spot Trading CLI

11 commands for perpetual futures and spot trading on Hyperliquid: market data, orderbook, funding rates, and order management.

## Pre-flight Checks

Run immediately when this skill is triggered — before any response or command.

1. **Check binary**: `which dapp-hyperliquid` — if not found, install via `plugin-store install hyperliquid`
2. **Check EVM_PRIVATE_KEY** for trading commands: verify it is set in the environment or `.env` file — if not, remind the user to set it before calling buy/sell/cancel/positions/balances/orders

## Authentication

**Data commands (markets, spot-markets, price, orderbook, funding):** No authentication needed.

**Trading commands (buy, sell, cancel, positions, balances, orders):** Require an EVM wallet private key:

```bash
# Add to .env file in your project directory
EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

The private key is used to sign Hyperliquid L1 actions via EIP-712 typed data signatures.

## Quickstart

```bash
# List all perpetual markets
dapp-hyperliquid markets

# List all spot markets

# Get BTC mid price

# Check BTC funding rate

## Key Concepts

- **Perpetual Futures**: Contracts with no expiry — funding payments keep price aligned with index
- **Funding Rate**: Hourly payment between longs/shorts. Positive = longs pay shorts
- **Leverage**: Cross margin by default (all positions share the same pool). BTC up to 50x
- **szDecimals**: Each asset has size precision — orders with wrong decimal places are rejected
- **USDC Margin**: All perp positions are margined in USDC on Hyperliquid L1

## Risk Warning

- Perpetual futures trading carries significant risk of loss
- Higher leverage means closer liquidation price — always monitor your liquidation price
- Always check `balances` before opening positions to ensure sufficient margin
- Use `positions` regularly to monitor unrealized PnL

## Response Guidelines

- Before any buy/sell, show symbol, size, price, leverage, and ask for confirmation
- Always check `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` is set before trading commands
- After any action, suggest 2–3 natural follow-ups
- Support both English and Chinese — respond in the user's language
