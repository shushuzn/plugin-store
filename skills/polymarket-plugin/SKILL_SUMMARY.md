# polymarket-plugin -- Skill Summary

## Overview
This skill enables trading on Polymarket prediction markets through Polygon. Users can browse markets, buy/sell YES/NO and categorical outcome tokens, manage positions, and cancel orders. The plugin uses the onchainos wallet for EIP-712 order signing and automatically handles USDC.e approvals for trades. All market data comes from Polymarket's CLOB, Gamma, and Data APIs.

## Usage
Install the plugin and connect your onchainos wallet to Polygon (chain 137). API credentials are auto-derived from the wallet on first use. Browse markets with `list-markets`, place orders with `buy`/`sell`, and monitor positions with `get-positions`.

## Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `list-markets` | Browse active prediction markets with optional filtering |
| `get-market` | Get detailed market info and order book by ID or slug |
| `get-positions` | View open positions and P&L for wallet address |
| `buy` | Purchase YES/NO shares with USDC.e |
| `sell` | Sell existing YES/NO shares |
| `cancel` | Cancel open orders by ID, market, or all orders |

## Triggers
